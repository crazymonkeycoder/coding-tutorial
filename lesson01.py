# Python is an interactive programming language. What that means is that you
# can write code, run your program, fix errors, and repeat the whole process
# without waiting for the computer to translate your code into binary code
# (all the 0's and 1's)!
#
# This means it's a great way for you to learn the language, and appreciate
# its simplicity without being hindered by complex syntax and ideas in some
# other programming languages.

# First, we're going to learn some of the basics of Python (even though you
# may know some of this).

# We're going to start with one of the most important "syntax" in the Python
# Programming Language - the comment!

# Comments are a way for programmers to jot down (in plain English) helpful
# tips (or comments) for other programmers (or your future self) on a piece
# of complicated code.

# This text here is a comment - you can tell because it starts with the
# hash-character (#). Some people call it the "pound" character, the "number"
# character, the tic-tac-toe grid, etc. Whatever you want to call it, it's
# the special character that denotes that the rest of that line is all a
# comment.

# A comment can appear almost anywhere in a prorgam (we'll get into why I say
# "almost" later on). It can start at the beginning of a line like all this
# comment that I've been typing, or it can also start in the middle of the line
# like this:

a = 5 # this is a variable assignment

# LESSON 1

# The first lesson that I have for you is to find the Lorem Ipsum text on the
# internet, and copy its content below as a comment. Lorem Ipsum is a Latin text
# that we programmers use as a "placeholder" text. What that means is that if we
# want to fill up a screen with some lengthy text, we use Lorem Ipsum to fill
# the screen (we don't care what it really means).

# Try to find the Lorem Ipsum text on Wikipedia and copy the first paragraph as
# a comment below:
# Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor#
# incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud 
# exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure 
# dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. 
# Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit 
# anim id est laborum.
